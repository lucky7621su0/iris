# Iris Flower Classification (KNN Model)

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **machine learning classification** example using the **Iris dataset**.  
It employs the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

## ⚙️ Features
- Loads and splits the Iris dataset into training and testing sets.  
- Trains a KNN classifier (k=3).  
- Evaluates model accuracy.  
- Makes predictions for sample input values.  

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification based on distance metrics.

## 📦 Requirements
Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
